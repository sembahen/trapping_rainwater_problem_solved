<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>The trapping rainwater problem involves finding the number of units that can trap water in given elevation map. The map contains a series of bars, each of unit size aligned in some sequence, with or without empty spaces in between.  The total number of bars (x-axis) can be different. The bars can be of different integer heights (y-axis value). The task is to fill the elevation map with rain water (colored blue in the given figure). Water can only get filled if there are boundaries on both ends and up to specific heights (just like you can only fill a bucket until its maximum height). The height of the bars must be non-negative. The solution should be the number of units that are trapped. The problem was solved using Python Programming language and Jupyter notebooks (files are attached).
